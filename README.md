## Introduction

Normally, when a wave of enemies spawn in they will all share the same monster type. This modifies that procedure to reroll for a new monster and elite affix after each one. In addition, the director is more likely to choose an expensive enemy when enough credits remain.

The above behavior has been tuned to provide a cadence that should feel almost the same as vanilla. However, it may be slightly more fast-paced or challenging than fighting uniform enemy groups. As an added benefit, this reduces the amount of fodder enemies that serve only to trigger area of effect and lessens elite spam, especially in the late game.

## Support

All credit to **Nuxlar** for the original idea, previously I contributed code to the deprecated [**DirectorRework**](https://thunderstore.io/package/Nuxlar/DirectorRework/1.1.1) and will continue to maintain this as an alternative. Note that it is also compatible with game versions prior to the *Seekers of the Storm* update.

- Please report any issues or significant incompatibilities discovered [here](https://github.com/6thmoon/EnemyVariety/issues).
